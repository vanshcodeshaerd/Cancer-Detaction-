Perfect 👍 If you want to **publish this on GitHub**, your README should do three things:

1. **Introduce the project** (what it is & why it exists)
2. **Guide users** (how to install, use, and contribute)
3. **Show professionalism** (badges, screenshots, tech stack, future plans)

Here’s a **ready-to-use template** for your **GitHub README.md** 👇
